### 🚀 An AI-powered Resume Screening System that semantically matches candidate resumes with job descriptions using **BERT embeddings** and **cosine similarity**.

---

## 📘 Overview
Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job posting.
Traditional keyword-based filtering misses out on good candidates due to wording differences.

This **Smart Resume Screening System** uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **BERT-based sentence embeddings** to measure how closely a resume aligns with a given job description — semantically, not just by keywords.

---

## 🧠 Features
✅ Resume text extraction from PDF
✅ Job description semantic matching
✅ BERT sentence embeddings for deep text understanding
✅ Cosine similarity scoring
✅ Streamlit Web App interface
✅ Fit-level recommendation (Excellent / Moderate / Low)
